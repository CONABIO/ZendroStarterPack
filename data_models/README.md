#Data models

Each database is a set of relational (or not relational) tables. 
Each database scheme is composed of a set of tables (or data models). ScienceDB engine 
permits to work with multiply data sets that can be distributed over a range of the 
local database servers or even be external databases. Each data model is described by 
a corresponding JSON object, and here is the place for these objects.


For the moment there is no per-project subdivision of the data models, so that 
subfolders placed here are not considered during automatic installation and can 
contain any additional project-specific documents.
